# Solar-Monitoring-System
This project involves the development of a real-time solar monitoring system. The system involves measuring the power produced by the panels.
From the power produced we can assume if there is a developping fault or not
THe system invovles a visual assesement of the PV Panels using an ESP32-CAM
The system also involves a thermopgraphic assesement of the PV Panels using the MLX90640 thermal camera and a 2.8TFT Display to show the thermal image, with a teensy4.0 as the mircrocontroller
